# Measuring Climate Change Exposure for Gabon


## Overview
This repo provides scripts for extracting, analyzing, and visualizing temperature and precipitation change for the African country of Gabon.

## Workflow
1. 01-Pre-processing - read data in from PostGIS and join it with other relational tables in the dataset. This was also a first step to look at the data.
2. 02-create-features - write functions to calculate each vegetation index based on spectral bands. For each veg index calculate the mean and standard deviation across time and save as a multiband raster. I used 6 different vegetation inices. 
3. 03-modeling-binary - model and hyperparameter selection using grid search and cross validation using 4 different kinds of models: logistic regression, random forests, support vector classification, and k-nearest neighbors.
4. I included a multi-class notebook to show that I tried!
5. Visualization is not included because it was done in a variety of programs, mainly QGIS and Tableau.

## Metrics used for Measuring Change in Climate
#### Mann-Kendall
The Mann-kendall statistic was used to measure trends for temperature and precipitation for the recent time-series (1979-2013). It is a non-parametric regression commonly used for time-series data to assess monotonic trend (linear or non-linear) significance. It is much less sensitive to outliers and skewed distributions. If the distribution of the deviations from the trend line is approximatly normally distributed, the M-K will return essentially the same result as simple linear regression.
#### Z-scores
Z-scores were used to measure significant  change between the future climatology (2061-2080) and the recent time period (1979-2013). This metric measures magnitude of change by representing how unusual the recent timeslice is relative to baseline variability. For each pixel, for each climate variable, a zscore is calculated by dividing the recent delta by the standard deviation of the baseline. The result (for a given pixel) is the number of standard deviations the recent mean is from the baseline. Assuming the variables are normally distributed (which, *in time*, they mostly are), each of these z-scores is a measure of how statistically significant the climate change was for that variable in that location. This metric shows direction of change in addition to magnitude of change – for example a value of 1 for average temperature means it’s getting warmer by 1 sd, and value of -1 means it’s getting cooler by 1 sd. This metric serves important purposes for climate change analysis: a) it standardizes all variables into one metric so that they can be compared with one another, and b) its more ecologically relevant because life strategies of organisms will generally be adapted to the historical variability of a given climate variable.


## Results
#### Recent 
The most striking result from looking a recent and future trends is how little precipitation is changing. The graph below shows statistically significant change for monthly temperature and precipitation across Gabon. For each 1km pixel across the geographic area of Gabon a time-series mann-kendall test was performed for the recent 35 year time-series. The areas in purple show significant change at 95% confidence level (p-value < 0.05). For temperature, all months have statistically significant change somewhere, if not entirely, across the country. Precipitation, however, shows hardley any change across the geographic region and across all months.

#### Future
For future projections it's useful to look at where models agree on the magnitude and direction of change. The graph below shows the average change in annual total precipitation (mm) and average temperature (C) for Gabon for each of 10 GCMs. All GCMs agree that temperatures are getting warmer but they disagree on whether precipiation is increasing or decreasing.

The graph below also investigates model agreement of direction and magnitude of change but at a higher temporal resolution - showing change across months of the year. The metric used to measure change is the z-score shown on the y-axis. These units represent how many standard deviations the future projection is from the mean of the recent historical time-period. The z-score values for precipitation are very small showing that projected future change for all models is well within the historical range of variability. The z-score values for temperature get up to 9 standard deviations which indicates extreme change and a relatively novel climate. These results for future projections are consistant with the recent trends for precipitation and temperature across the 1979-2013 year time-series. 

The graph also shows that models agree more or less for certain seasons. For precipitation, models agree more for the dry season than they do for the wet season. For temperature, models generally agree across all months for the direction of change but vary in magnitude.
